    "BRIEF DESCRIPTION": ["The Leon series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, moderately rapid to moderately slowly permeable soils on upland flats, depressions, stream terraces and tidal areas. They formed in sandy marine sediments of the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A), the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A) and to a lesser extent in the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) and the North-Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 138).  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent."],

    "USE AND VEGETATION": [":  Most areas of Leon soils are used for forestry, rangeland and pasture.  Areas with adequate water control are used for cropland and vegetables.  The natural vegetation consists of longleaf pine, slash pine, water oak, myrtle, with a thick undergrowth of sawpalmetto, running oak, fetterbush and other lyionia, inkberry (gallberry), wax myrtle, goldenrod, ligustrina, dog fennel, chalky bluestem, lowbush blueberry, creeping bluestem and pineland threeawn (wiregrass).  In depressions, the vegetation is dominated by brackenfern, smooth sumac and swamp cyrilla are common.  Vegetation in the tidal marshes includes bushy seaoxeye, marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, batis, and smooth cordgrass. "],
