    "COMPETING SERIES": [": These are the Priestgrade and Stineway soils. Stineway soils have a hue of 10YR, are neutral to moderately alkaline, and are formed in metamorphic rock. Priestgrade soils have rock fragments in the soil profile that are typically channers and flagstones and are formed in metasedimentary rock. "],
    "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": [": Pardee soils are on and the summit, shoulder, and backslope positions on terrace remnants, eroded fan remnants. Where there is mound and swale topography, Pardee soils occur on the mound positions. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. They formed in dark metamorphic and quartzitic gravelly and cobbly alluvium from mixed sources overlying unrelated volcaniclastic or metamorphic bedrock. Elevation ranges from 35 to 320 meters. Climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 465 mm to 660 mm. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 17 degrees C. Mean January air temperature is about 8 degrees C, and mean July air temperature is 25 to 26 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 325 to 355 days."],
    "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": [": These are the Amador, Auburn, Corning, Pentz, Ranchoseco and Redding soils. Amador, Auburn and Pentz soils are on hillslopes and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Corning and Redding soils are on similar positions and have less than 35 percent rock fragments, and more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ranchoseco soils are less than 25 cm to a lithic contact and are in the swales between mounds."],
    "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": [": Well drained. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the soil. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is low to moderately high."],
    "USE AND VEGETATION": [": Used primarily for rangeland. Vegetation is annual grasses and forbs with scattered blue oaks at higher elevations. Understory species include wild oat, bromes, soft chess, stork's bill, foxtail fescue, Mediterranean barley, and smooth cat's ear."],
