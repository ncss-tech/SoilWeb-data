    "COMPETING SERIES": [": This is the Aiken series. Aiken soils occur on lahars. They are greater than 90 cm to a horizon with clay texture. "],
    "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": [": Sites soils occur on summits and backslopes of mountain slopes with slope gradients of 2 to 75 percent at elevations of 500 to 1200 meters. They formed in material weathered from metabasic and metasedimentary rocks. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 890 mm to 1825 mm, of which 1 to 10 percent occurs as snow. Mean annual air temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, average January temperature about 4 degrees C, and average July temperature about 22 degrees C. The frost-free season is about 185 to 265 days."],
    "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": [": These are the Boomer, Holland, Horseshoe, Jocal, Mariposa and Musick soils. All have argillic horizons and occur on backslopes of hills and mountains. Mariposa soils have a lithic contact with metasedimentary rock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Boomer, Holland, Horseshoe, Jocal and Musick soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Horseshoe soils occur on lahars and Tertiary-age terrace remnants. Jocal and Mariposa, like Sites, occur on metasedimentary rocks. Holland and Musick formed from intrusive igneous rocks."],
    "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": [": Well-drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately low in the argillic horizon."],
    "USE AND VEGETATION": [": Used for timber, with some areas cleared and used for deciduous fruit orchards. Native vegetation is coniferous forest with associated hardwoods, including ponderosa pine, sugar pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, incense cedar, California black oak, tan oak, and Pacific madrone."],
    "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT": [": Primarily in the Sierra Nevada Mountains but also in the Southern Cascade Mountains, Central Coast California Coast Range, and the Siskyou-Trinity Area; MLRAs 22A, 22B, 15, and 5.
