    "BRIEF DESCRIPTION": ["The Pierre series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum, or local alluvium over residuum, derived from shale bedrock.  Pierre soils are on gently sloping to rolling hillslopes on uplands on the Pierre Shale Plains (MLRA 60A).  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F)."],
